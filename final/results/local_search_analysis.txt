The inversion algorithm consistently produced the smallest minimum cost tour across all TSP cases except for 
EIL76 â€“ for which jump produced the smallest minimum tour. The inversion algorithm also produced the smallest 
cost averages across all TSP instances, while the exchange algorithm produced the highest mean tour cost for all 
instances. The difference between the exchange and inversion mean tour costs grew wider as the dimension of the 
TSP problem increased; for EIL51, the difference was 122.7 between the algorithms, while for USA13509 there was a 
large, significant difference of 205845919, demonstrating the importance of efficiency for large TSP instances. 
The inversion operation allowed the algorithm to keep large chunks of the tour that were efficient, as it is 
minimally disruptive to relative order.
