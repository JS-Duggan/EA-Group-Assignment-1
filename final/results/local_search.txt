Test your local algorithms on the instances EIL51, EIL76, EIL101, ST70, KROA100,
KROC100, KROD100, LIN105, PCB442, PR2392, USA13509 from TSPlib. Run
each local search algorithm on each instance 30 times where in each run the initial
permutation is chosen uniformly at random. Report for each algorithm on each
instance in a file results/local_search.txt the minimum and mean tour length
obtained.
