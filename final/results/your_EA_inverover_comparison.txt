Among the three evolutionary algorithms tested in Exercise 6, the exploitative algorithm performed the best, achieivng lower mean tour lengths
than the balanced or exploratory algorithms. However, it still performed worse than the Inver-Over Evolutionary Algorithm. Across the TSP
instances, the Inver-Over resulted in consistently lower mean values and standard deviations. This means that the Inver-Over not only produces
better results, but also provides more consistency and reliability. Therefore, even though the exploitative approach performed well compared
to the other designed algorithms, the Inver-Over provides the most optimal and reliable performance.
